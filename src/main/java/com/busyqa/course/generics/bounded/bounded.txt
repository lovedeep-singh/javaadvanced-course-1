Bounded Type Parameters

There may be times when you want to restrict the types that can be used as type 
arguments in a parameterized type. For example, a method that operates on numbers 
might only want to accept instances of Number or its subclasses. This is what 
bounded type parameters are for.

To declare a bounded type parameter, list the type parameter's name, followed by 
the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound, which in this example is Number. 
Note that, in this context, extends is used in a general sense to mean either 
"extends" (as in classes) or "implements" (as in interfaces).
