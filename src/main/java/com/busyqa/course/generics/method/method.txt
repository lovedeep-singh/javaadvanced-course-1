Generic Methods

Generic methods are methods that introduce their own type parameters. This is 
similar to declaring a generic type, but the type parameter's scope is limited 
to the method where it is declared. Static and non-static generic methods are 
allowed, as well as generic class constructors.

The syntax for a generic method includes a list of type parameters, inside angle 
brackets, which appears before the method's return type. For static generic 
methods, the type parameter section must appear before the method's return type.
