Autoboxing and Unboxing (Since Java 5)

Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the 
primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, 
converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on. 
If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.

Autoboxing and unboxing lets developers write cleaner code, making it easier to 
read. The following table lists the primitive types and their corresponding 
wrapper classes, which are used by the Java compiler for autoboxing and unboxing:

Primitive type - Wrapper class
  boolean           Boolean
  byte              Byte
  char              Character
  float             Float
  int               Integer
  long              Long
  short             Short
  double            Double
