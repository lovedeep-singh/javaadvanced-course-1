Java Search Algorithms

Search algorithm is an algorithm for finding an item with specified properties 
among a collection of items. The items may be stored individually as records in 
a database or may be elements of a search space defined by a mathematical formula 
or procedure, such as the roots of an equation with integer variables or a 
combination of the two.
